<p>It’s not every day that scientists observe a new species emerging in real time. Charles Darwin believed that speciation probably took place over hundreds if not thousands of generations, advancing far too gradually to be detected directly. The biologists who followed him have generally defaulted to a similar understanding and have relied on indirect clues, gleaned from genomes and fossils, to infer complex organisms’ evolutionary histories.</p>
<p>Some of those clues suggest that interbreeding <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/interspecies-hybrids-play-a-vital-role-in-evolution-20170824/">plays a larger role in the formation of new species</a> than previously thought. But the issue remains contentious: Hybridization has been definitively shown to cause widespread speciation only in plants. When it comes to animals, it has remained a hypothesis (albeit one that’s gaining increasing support) about events that typically occurred in the distant, unseen past.</p>
<p>Until now. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2017/11/20/science.aao4593.full">In a paper published last month in <em>Science</em></a>, researchers reported that a new animal species had evolved by hybridization — and that it had occurred before their eyes in the span of merely two generations. The breakneck pace of that speciation event turned heads both in the scientific community and in the media. The mechanism by which it occurred is just as noteworthy, however, because of what it suggests about the undervalued role of hybrids in evolution.</p>

<h2>Eyewitnesses to Speciation</h2>
<p>In 1981, <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/peter-grant">Peter</a> and <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/b-rosemary-grant">Rosemary Grant</a>, <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/watching-evolution-happen-in-two-lifetimes-20160922/">the famous husband-and-wife team</a> of evolutionary biologists at Princeton University, had already been studying Darwin’s finches on the small Galápagos island Daphne Major for nearly a decade. So when they spotted a male bird that looked and sounded different from the three species residing on the island, they immediately knew he didn’t belong. Genetic analysis showed he was a large cactus finch (<em>Geospiza conirostris</em>) from another island, either Española or Gardner, more than 60 miles away — too great a distance for the bird to fly home.</p>
<p>Tracking the marooned male bird’s activity, the Grants observed him as he mated with two female medium ground finches (<em>G. fortis</em>) on Daphne and produced hybrid offspring. Such interbreeding by isolated animals in the wild is not uncommon, though biologists have usually dismissed it as irrelevant to evolution because the hybrids tend to be unfit. Often they cannot reproduce, or they fail to compete effectively against established species and quickly go extinct. Even when the hybrids are fertile and fit, they frequently get reabsorbed into the original species by mating with their parent populations.</p>
